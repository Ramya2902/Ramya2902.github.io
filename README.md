	Claim Chain System:
•	Developed a “ClaimChain” system which focusses on the problems in insurance claim processing. In this automation of insurance claim processing is via Blockchain platform.
•	Addressed application-level fraudulent claims through fraud detection module which provides 98% accuracy for detection of fraud claims. Also categorized infrastructure-level threat modeling via attack tree formalism for data integrity attacks and provided quantitative analysis through statistical model checking tool i.e., UPPAAL.
o	Technologies: Angular Framework, Hyperledger Composer, AWS, Typescript
	Honest Chain System:
•	Implemented a system named “Honest Chain” system on a cloud-based system which involved predictive data analytics. This system allows organizations to have incentive-based and trustworthy cooperation via Blockchain platform and provides protected healthcare records to customers.
o	Technologies: Python, AWS, SQLite, Hyperledger Composer, Flask Framework
	Recommender System:
•	Implemented evidence-based recommender system with cloud and edge computing to provide thin client users sorted compilation of publications based on evidence pyramid levels, used to filter information quality. Implemented social platform using open source Humhub platform for improving interaction between the users.
o	Technologies: Humhub, Java, Angular framework


	Publications:
•	HonestChain: Consortium blockchain for protected data sharing in health information systems – Peer-Peer Netw Appl. 2021
•	Trust Model for Efficient Honest Broker based Healthcare Data Access and Processing – IEEE PerCom Workshops 2021
•	Evidence-Based Recommender System for a COVID-19 Publication Analytics Service – IEEE Access 2021
